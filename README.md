# Agent Core

**Production-grade governance for AI coding agents.**
Principles, rules, and skills that keep Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, and
custom agents from drifting away from your architecture.

## What is this?

Agent Core is a **governance layer for AI-assisted software engineering**.
Drop it into any project. Your AI agents read it on every session and follow
it across architecture, domain modeling, testing, security, observability,
CI/CD, payments, and migrations.

Works with **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Aider**, and any
agent that respects `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` conventions. Skills follow the
[Claude Code Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/skills) format and can be
mounted at `.claude/skills/` for native auto-discovery.

> Architecture must not emerge accidentally.

---

## Install

From the host project root:

```bash
# vendor agent-core (or git submodule add)
git clone https://github.com/kakeru-kageshima/agent-core.git
./agent-core/init/bootstrap.sh

git add AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md && git commit -m "Install Agent Core"
```

Windows:

```bat
agent-core\init\bootstrap.cmd
```

That's it. The bootstrap writes only **two** files to your project root:
`AGENTS.md` (entrypoint) and `CLAUDE.md` (redirect). Runtime state goes into
`agent-core/generated/tasks/`, which is gitignored.

        └── tasks/
            ├── todo.md
            └── lessons.md
```

The agent loads only what the current task needs (classification → context
profile). 17k lines of governance, but the per-turn footprint stays small.

## Why Agent Core

Modern AI coding tools are powerful — but **without constraints they drift**.

| Symptom                                    | What Agent Core does about it                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Architecture inconsistency PR-by-PR        | Layer / dependency / aggregate rules enforced on review  |
| Plausible code that fails real edge cases  | TDD skill is mandatory for behavior change               |
| Migrations that break prod at the worst moment | Expand→migrate→contract enforced; rollback required  |
| Money math wrong in subtle ways            | `MONEY_HANDLING_RULES` + `payment-integration` skill     |
| "It works on my machine" deploys           | CICD / observability / release-strategy rules            |
| Schemas that lie to consumers              | Database / API design rules treat schema as public API   |
| Same correction every time                 | `capture-lesson` skill writes durable rules into project |

Agent Core covers the full surface: **web frameworks, frontend, backend,
databases, infrastructure, CI/CD, security, observability, payments,
accessibility, and legacy-system migration**.

## How it compares

|                                   | Agent Core | `.cursorrules` / Cursor Rules | `CLAUDE.md` alone | Prompt collections | Spec-driven (e.g. SpecKit) |
| --------------------------------- | :--------: | :---------------------------: | :---------------: | :----------------: | :------------------------: |
| Architectural principles          | ✅          | minimal                       | minimal           | ❌                  | partial                    |
| Enforceable rules with hierarchy  | ✅          | flat list                     | flat list         | ❌                  | per-spec                   |
| Situational skills (on-demand)    | ✅          | ❌                             | ❌                 | partial            | ❌                          |

| Security / observability / payments | ✅          | ❌                             | ❌                 | partial            | ❌                          |
| Schema + system migration playbook | ✅          | ❌                             | ❌                 | ❌                  | ❌                          |
| Runtime task tracking             | ✅          | ❌                             | partial           | ❌                  | ✅                          |
| Self-improvement loop             | ✅          | ❌                             | ❌                 | ❌                  | ❌                          |
| Multi-agent compatibility         | ✅          | Cursor only                   | Claude only       | varies             | varies                     |
| Bootstrap + migration tooling     | ✅          | ❌                             | ❌                 | ❌                  | partial                    |

The differentiator is the **integrated layering**: principles → rules →
skills → runtime, with deterministic routing between them.

## Default frontend stack

For new frontend projects, Agent Core defaults to:

| Tool          | Role                                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **SvelteKit** | filesystem routing, SSR / SSG-capable               |
| **TypeScript** (strict) | type-safe by default                      |
| **Tailwind CSS** | utility-first, design tokens in `tailwind.config.ts` |
| **pnpm**      | package manager + workspaces                        |

A different stack is a deliberate, written decision (skill `adr`). The
four-layer architecture (`interfaces / applications / domains /
architectures`) is framework-agnostic — only the adapter layer changes.

See [`PACKAGE_LAYOUT_FRONTEND_RULES.md`](rules/PACKAGE_LAYOUT_FRONTEND_RULES.md).

---

## Use with Claude Code (optional)

Agent Core skills follow the [Claude Code Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/skills)
SKILL.md format. To enable native auto-discovery in your host project:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude
ln -s ../agent-core/skills .claude/skills
# or:  cp -R agent-core/skills .claude/skills
```

The bootstrap intentionally does **not** symlink — it is an explicit
opt-in.

---

## Upgrading from an older version

When you replace or update `agent-core/`, run the migration script from the
host project root:

```bash
./agent-core/init/migration.sh           # dry run
./agent-core/init/migration.sh --apply   # execute
```

It relocates user content from legacy locations (`tasks/`, `agent-works/`,
`agent-spec/WORK_STATE.md`, `agent-input/`) into `agent-core/generated/`,
removes deprecated Agent Core scaffolding, and reports drift on
`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` without overwriting your customisation.

Backups land at `agent-core/generated/migration-backup-<UTC>/`. Idempotent.

  operational, data foundations.
- [`rules/`](rules/) — 34 enforceable rule files.
- [`skills/`](skills/) — 30 on-demand playbooks.

## Who this is for

- Teams shipping production systems with AI agents.
- Engineers who care about long-term maintainability.
- Builders of payment, multi-tenant, or PII-handling systems.
- Anyone tired of correcting the same agent mistakes repeatedly.

**Not for:** rapid throwaway prototypes, scripts, or one-off scratch code.
Agent Core is intentionally opinionated. It favours safety over speed.

---

## Status & roadmap

- ✅ v1.0 — 7 principles, 34 rules, 30 skills, bootstrap + migration tooling.
- 🚧 More skills (e.g. `mobile-release`, `data-pipeline`).
- 🚧 Plug-ins for Cursor `.cursor/rules/` and Copilot custom instructions.
- 🚧 Optional MCP server exposing rules and skills as queryable resources.

See [issues](../../issues) for current roadmap and open work.

clarity, determinism, or cross-agent consistency are warmly received.
